# Javascript Algorithms

This is a repo setup for various javascript algorithms. These are in large part coding excersizes for interviews but not much for practical usage. 

No big O ridiculousness here though. Just processes that read, receive and transform data. There are far more complex algorithms out there than what you will find here. But the purpose of this repo is to have the best middle ground for code that is effective, understandable and performant. Beyond that it's all academic and I will gladly leave complexity to the academics.
