# Javascript Algorithms

This is a repo setup for various javascript algorithms. These are in large part coding excersizes for interviews and practical
coding situations. No big O ridiculousness here. Just processes that read receive and transform data. There are far more complex algorithms out there than what you will find here. But the purpose of this repo is to have the best middle ground for code that is effective, understandable and performant. Beyond that its all academic and you can have that.
