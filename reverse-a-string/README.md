# The Issue

So in comparison to a lot of truly useless crap algorithms our there, there actually is a lot of use cases for this.
You wouldn't think that just to look at it. But development is a weird world and you actually wind up doing this once in a while.

We will talk about some of those a little later on but I wanted to mention why there are several ways of doing this. 
In reality its quite simple. The first one is just "can you think your way through this"? Lets be honest, there are a lot
more alogrithms out there than we would like to admit that serve a sole purpose of "Lets see how stupid you are" in the 
interview process. This is a prime example. At first glance the most common way to do this is very obvious just chain the
methods together. Split, reverse and join...what could be easier. And you are exactly right. No matter what your "tech lead"
tells you this is still the way most of us do this day in and day out. So why even mention the other ways?

Yes, these process at very different rates and just like all other unfair things in life. The most complicated is the most
performant. So there you go.
